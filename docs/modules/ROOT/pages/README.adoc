file and then configures the development environment.

=== `sqldeveloper.archive`

This state will install sqldeveloper from archive only.

=== `sqldeveloper.config`

This state will configure npmrc and/or environment and has a dependency
on `sqldeveloper.install` via include list.

=== `sqldeveloper.linuxenv`

This state will install some sqldeveloper linux-alternatives on
GNU/Linux.

=== `sqldeveloper.clean`

_Meta-state (This is a state that includes other states)_.

this state will undo everything performed in the `sqldeveloper`
meta-state in reverse order, i.e. removes the configuration file and
then uninstalls the package.

=== `sqldeveloper.config.clean`

This state will remove the configuration of sqldeveloper and has a
dependency on `sqldeveloper.package.clean` via include list.

=== `sqldeveloper.archive.clean`

This state will remove sqldeveloper package and has a dependency on
`sqldeveloper.config.clean` via include list.

=== `sqldeveloper.linuxenv.clean`

This state will remove sqldeveloper linux-alternatives on GNU/Linux.

== Testing

Linux testing is done with `kitchen-salt`.

=== Requirements

* Ruby
* Docker

[source,bash]
----
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ bin/kitchen test [platform]
----

Where `[platform]` is the platform name defined in `kitchen.yml`, e.g.
`debian-9-2019-2-py3`.

=== `bin/kitchen converge`

Creates the docker instance and runs the `sqldeveloper` main state,
ready for testing.

=== `bin/kitchen verify`

Runs the `inspec` tests on the actual instance.

=== `bin/kitchen destroy`

Removes the docker instance.

=== `bin/kitchen test`

Runs all of the stages above in one go: i.e. `destroy` + `converge` +
`verify` + `destroy`.

=== `bin/kitchen login`

Gives you SSH access to the instance for manual testing.
